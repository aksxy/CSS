#HTML ID & CLASS ATTRIBUT

-When an HTML element is given identifire for that element.
-On the other hand, when an HTML element is given a class, it now belongs to that class
 mor then one elements can belong to a single class but every element must have a unique
 id(i/assignd).
-we can add multiple classes to an element like this:-
Ex:- 
     <div id="first" class="c1 c2 c3">
          --------
          --------
      </div>
